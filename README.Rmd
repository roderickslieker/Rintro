# Introduction #

## The R interface ##

<img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png", alt="Rlogo", width="150">

<br>

- Originated from proprietary S programming language (80s) and developed into R (1995)

- Comes in many flavours, like *R gui* (hardly a user interface), *Rstudio*, *Eclipse*

- Save scripts as R files, which can be opened with all kinds of software (*R*, *Rstudio*, *Sublime*, *Notepad* etc. )

- *Annotate scripts*: that means that one uses the hashtag to write in a few lines what is going on in that bit of syntax.  

- **Safer and more reproducible than other software**: source data is not changed, scripts can be shared with others

- Save objects to `Rdata files, so you can continue with it next time without the need for rerunning the complete script

<br>

<br>
  
## Other software to be used with R ##

- Rstudio is very useful: https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/

It has many advantages: integrated help, use of tab key, more stable than Rgui. 

- Sublime when only typing syntax (to link with servers): https://www.sublimetext.com/

- Packages: for an (almost infinity) number of applications people have developed packages, for example:

CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/

Bioconductor: http://bioconductor.org/

- Git to track your code: www.github.com

# Starting simple with R #

```{r start}
1+1

#Assign values to variables
a <- 1
a + a

#But the equal sign also works!
aa = 1
aa+aa
#But professionals use the arrow and not the equal sign to distinguish from  == :)

#Or multiple values or variables
b <- c(1,2,3) # c, concatenate
b

#Variables can have any names, but don't assign names to existing objects, such as sum, c, sd etc
#Spaces are not allowed as well as special symbols


#Sequences
rep(x = 1,times = 5)
seq(from = 1,to = 5, by=0.5)
seq(from = 1,to = 5, length.out = 100)
```
<br>

<br>

# Operators #

Operators can be used to compare and select on numbers, characters (and sometimes factors)

```{r logicals, results='asis', echo=F}
library(knitr)
kable(x = data.frame(Operator = c("+","-","*","/","^","%%","%/%"), Description = c("Addition","Substraction","Multiplication","Division","Exponentiation","Modulus (7%%3 is 1)","Integer division (7%/%3 is 2)")))

kable(x = data.frame(Operator = c("<","<=",">",">=","==","%in%","!=","!x","x|y","x&y","isTRUE(x)"), Description = c("Less than", "Equal to or less than","More than","Equal to or more than","Equal to","Is it in there?","Not equal to","Not x","x OR y","x AND y","Is X TRUE?")))
```

```{r examples}
#Examples
3 != 5
5 != 5
5 == 5

#Why would you want that?
#Great for subsetting vectors but also objects!
a <- 1:10
a
a[a > 5]
a[a <= 2]
a[a==5]
a %in% 5
a[a %in% 2]
a[a==3 | a==5]
```



<br>

<br>

# The main classes #

- Numeric and integers
- Characters
- Factors
- Lists

```{r classes}
#Numeric
num <- c(1,2,3)
#Class can be used to view the class
class(num)

#Character
characters <- c("A","B","C")
class(characters)

#Factor, same as character but with the levels in the data
factors <- factor(c("A","A","B","B","C"), levels=c("A","B","C"))
class(factors)


# List 
list(GroupA = 1:3, GroupB = 2:5 , GroupC = 3:5)
```


## Switching between classes ##

You can also convert one class to the other:

```{r switch}
#From character to numeric
a <- c("1","2","3")
class(a)
head(a)
b <- as.numeric(a)
class(b)
head(b)

#From numeric to character
c <- as.character(b)
class(c)


#From factor to numeric
af <- factor(c("5","6","7"))
# This is not right:
as.numeric(af)
# But this is:
as.numeric(as.character(af))
```




<br>

<br>

# Objects #

## Creating objects ##

- Data frames
  
  Advantages: can hold multiple classes, columns can be viewed easily
  Disadvantage: one cannot do analyses on the entire object
  

- Matrices
  
  Advantage: very quick and useful for matrix calculations.
  Disadvantage: less easy to modify (add columns, change class of data)

```{r objects}
#Data.frame: can hold multiple classes
df <- data.frame(Group = c(1,2,3), Outcome = c(2,3,6))

#head can be used to view objects
head(df)
#str will give the classes of the different columns
str(df)
class(df)

#Groups can called with the dollar sign (dataframe only)
df$Group


#Matrix:
mtrx <- matrix(1:25, nrow=5)
head(mtrx)
str(mtrx)
class(mtrx)

#Calculate something at once
mtrx*mtrx
```

## Modifying objects ##

```{r modifying}
#Adding rownames to files 
rownames(df) <- c("A","B","C")
#The file has already colnames
colnames(df)

#What doesn't work:
#rownames(mtrx) <- c("A","B","C")
#Why not?
## Learn to understand error codes (read them carefully)
## If you don't get the error, google it. There is ALWAYS someone before you who had the same question.
## This does work. Why?
rownames(mtrx) <- c("A","B","C","D","E")
```


##Modifying objects part 2##

If the comma is on the right of the indices so [1:2,] then it is applied to the *rows*

If the comma is on the left of the indices so [,1:2] then it is applied on the *columns*

```{r modifyingP2}
#Data.frame
df[1:2, ] #First two lines
df[,1:2]
df[df$Group == 1,]

#Different (order has changed!)
df[2:1, ] 

#You can also subset by rownames
df[c("A","B"),]

#Or colnames
df[,c("Group","Outcome")]

#Subset using operators
df[df$Group ==1,]
df[df$Group >= 2,]
df[df$Group != 1,]
df[rownames(df) != "A",]

#Add new columns
df$NewCol <- c(1,2,5)
head(df)


# Modifying a matrix:
mtrx[1:2,]
mtrx[1:2] #Different!
```

## Switching classes ##
```{r switchclass}
#From matrix to dataframe
dfm <- as.data.frame(mtrx)

#From dataframe to matrix
dm <- as.matrix(dfm) #Will convert all columns to 1 class, likely character!
```

# Loading and saving from R #

## Reading from files ##

R can read all types of files (with or without required packages), such as txt, csv, xlsx (package: xlsx), sav spss file  (package: Hmisc)

```{r read}
# Setting a working directory (= tell R where to find files and where to save files.)
setwd("/Users/roderick/Documents/Onderwijs/IntroR/")

#Reading csv files (comma delimited)
IrisCSV <- read.table("Iris.csv", sep=",", header=T)

#Or we give the full path
IrisCSV <- read.table("/Users/roderick/Documents/Onderwijs/IntroR/Iris.csv", sep=",", header=T)

head(IrisCSV)
str(IrisCSV)

#Reading tab delimited 
IrisTXT <- read.table("Iris as text file.txt", sep="\t", header=T)
head(IrisTXT)
str(IrisTXT)
```

## Save to files ##

```{r save}
data(iris)

# Save objects in analysis
save(iris, file="Iris.RData")
# Load objects from previous sessions
load("Iris.RData")

#One can also save to common formats such as csv, txt
write.table(iris, file="Iris as text file.txt", sep="\t", col.names=T, row.names=F)
write.table(iris, file="Iris as csv file.csv", sep=";", col.names=T, row.names=F)
```

# Describing data using descriptive statistics #

```{r summaries}
#The iris dataset is a build in dataset

#Describe dataset
nrow(iris)
ncol(iris)
length(iris$Sepal.Length)
sum(iris$Sepal.Length)
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
median(iris$Sepal.Length)
sd(iris$Sepal.Length)

# Summary statistics by group
# by(data = someVariable, INDICES = someGrouping, FUN = aGroupingFunction)

by(data = iris$Sepal.Length, INDICES = iris$Species, mean)
# Same as:
by(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
#Store in variable
meanGroup <- by(data = iris$Sepal.Length, INDICES = iris$Species, FUN = mean)
SDGroup <- by(data = iris$Sepal.Length, INDICES = iris$Species, FUN = sd)
LengthGroup <- by(data = iris$Sepal.Length, INDICES = iris$Species, FUN = length)

class(meanGroup)

#Small trick:
as.list(meanGroup)
statistics <- cbind( as.list(meanGroup),as.list(SDGroup), as.list(LengthGroup))
colnames(statistics) <- c("Mean","SD","n")
statistics
```

# Packages #

Packages are an infinite rich source to facilitate your analysis

*To install packages from CRAN*

install.packages("ggplot2")

*Or when from Bioconductor:*

source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

biocLite("IRanges")

#Plotting
R base (without packages) can plot all kind of plots but are not very nice. 

ggplot2 is a very commonly used package for plotting. Although the approach is a bit different, the plots are nicer and more flexible to change. For more help see: http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ or google!


```{r plotting}
library(ggplot2)

#Scatter plot
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, xlab="Sepal length", ylab="Sepal width")

ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, col=Species))+ # Define variables
  geom_point()+ # We want to plot dots
  ggtitle("Some title")+ #Add title to graph
  xlab("Sepal length")+ #Add x-axis labels
  ylab("Sepal width")+ #Add y-axis labels
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F"))


# Boxplot
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length~iris$Species, xlab="Sepal length", ylab="Sepal width")

ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, fill=Species))+ #Define variables
  geom_boxplot()+ #What kind of graph?
  ggtitle("Some title")+ #Add title to graph
  xlab("Sepal length")+ #Add x-axis labels
  ylab("Sepal width")+ #Add y-axis labels
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F")) # Change colors using HEX colors

# Jitter plot
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, col=Species))+ #Define variables
  geom_jitter(width=0.2)+
  ggtitle("Some title")+ 
  xlab("Sepal length")+ 
  ylab("Sepal width")+ 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F")) 

# Smoothed line graph
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length, col=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  ggtitle("Some title")+
  xlab("Sepal length")+
  ylab("Sepal width")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F"))

ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length, col=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=loess)+
  ggtitle("Some title")+
  xlab("Sepal length")+
  ylab("Sepal width")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F"))
```

```{r ontop}
#One can also different types of plots on top of each other
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, fill=Species))+ #Define variables
  geom_boxplot()+ #What kind of graph?
  geom_jitter(width=0.2)+
  ggtitle("Some title")+ #Add title to graph
  xlab("Sepal length")+ #Add x-axis labels
  ylab("Sepal width")+ #Add y-axis labels
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F")) # Change colors using HEX colors
```

## Saving plots ##
```{r savingplots}
library(ggplot2)

pdf("Boxplot of iris data.pdf")
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, fill=Species))+ #Define variables
  geom_boxplot()+ #What kind of graph?
  ggtitle("Some title")+ #Add title to graph
  xlab("Sepal length")+ #Add x-axis labels
  ylab("Sepal width")+ #Add y-axis labels
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F")) # Change colors using HEX colors
dev.off()

jpeg("Boxplot of iris data.jpg", width = 10, height = 10, units="cm", res=200)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, fill=Species))+ #Define variables
  geom_boxplot()+ #What kind of graph?
  ggtitle("Some title")+ #Add title to graph
  xlab("Sepal length")+ #Add x-axis labels
  ylab("Sepal width")+ #Add y-axis labels
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#009AC7","#132B41","#8B1A4F")) # Change colors using HEX colors
dev.off()

```

#More advanced R: creating and running for-loops and functions#

A function can replicate the same thing over and over for multiple columns to reduce the amount of work and reduce errors. We use the `EuStockMarkets` dataset

```{r functions}
data("EuStockMarkets")

# We want the characteristics for each row 
getSummary <- function(col, Data)
{
  co <- colnames(Data)[col]
  me <- mean(Data[,col])
  sdv <- sd(Data[,col])
  #Now we create a dataset to give everything back
  out <- data.frame(Group = co, Mean = me, SD=sdv)
  out
}

getSummary(col = 1, Data=EuStockMarkets)

#But now for all
dim(EuStockMarkets)
res <- lapply(1:4, getSummary, Data=EuStockMarkets)
newTable <- do.call(rbind, res)
newTable
```
